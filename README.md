## Face Recognition Model with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the development of a deep learning-based face recognition model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. The goal is to classify images of faces into their respective labels using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## *Features*

### Data Preprocessing:
Loaded and preprocessed a dataset of facial images and their corresponding labels.
Applied label mapping to rename specific labels for clarity.
Shuffled and visualized the dataset to inspect class distribution.
### Model Architecture:
Built a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
Added dense layers for classification with a softmax output for multi-class prediction.
### Training and Evaluation:
Trained the model using a labeled dataset with categorical cross-entropy loss.
Visualized model performance during training.
### Testing and Visualization:
Tested the model on unseen data.
Displayed test images alongside their true and predicted labels to evaluate model accuracy.
### Technologies Used:
* Python
* TensorFlow/Keras
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Pandas
